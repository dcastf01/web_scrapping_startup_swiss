# web_scrapping_startup_swiss

Scripts to get a list of startups from Switzerland (repo and data at the end of the post)

Right now I am looking for a job in Switzerland, more specifically in Lausanne or the Vaud region. I also have the personal requirement that I would like to work in a technology company where I can develop myself technically.

For this, it occurred to me to look for startups and I found the following page https://www.swiss.tech/ where the companies within here seem to fit very well with what I am looking for. The problem was that I could not filter by location. So I have made a repository to perform web scrapping and in this way obtain the list of companies. In this way, now, I can filter myself and be able to send resumes to the companies that meet my criteria.
